# Transformer-Architecture

Welcome to the Transformer Architecture Implementation repository! In this project, I've implemented the groundbreaking Transformer architecture, a deep learning model known for its effectiveness in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The Transformer has revolutionized the field of deep learning, enabling efficient training on large datasets and achieving state-of-the-art results.

In this notebook, I've meticulously crafted:

1- **Encoder-Decoder Stack:** A fundamental building block for sequence-to-sequence tasks, enabling robust context capture and generation. <\br>
2- **Attention Mechanism:** The core of the Transformer, fostering contextual understanding and learning relationships between input tokens. <\br>
3- **Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks:** Empowering the model to model complex, non-linear transformations within each position of a sequence. <\br>
4- **Embeddings and Softmax:** Foundational elements for representing and interpreting data in the model's architecture. <\br>
5- **Positional Encoding:** A crucial ingredient for infusing sequence order information into the model. <\br>
6- **Full Model:** The culmination of these components, resulting in a comprehensive Transformer model ready for diverse NLP applications. <\br>
Explore the notebooks and code to uncover the inner workings of the Transformer, and feel free to adapt and extend it for your own projects and research
